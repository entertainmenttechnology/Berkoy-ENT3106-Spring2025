### COURSE DESCRIPTION  
Supervised laboratory in the technical areas of live, video, and/or multimedia production. Students gain hands-on experience in the planning and implementation of production procedures and operations, with an emphasis on careful pre-planning, appropriate safety procedures and on follow-up critiques and evaluation of the work done. Assignments are made on the basis of the ability and the prior achievements of each student, assuring a variety of work experiences. ENT 3106 is required to be taken twice in the major for 6 credits. Course may be taken as an elective 2 additional times for 6 elective credits. 

### SECTION DESCRIPTION   
**_ARE YOU PREPARED?_** is an interactive art installation and performance, presented as an interactive lecture by a talking balloon. As the lecture proceeds, the balloon makes increasingly absurd requests, singling out members of the audience to participate in body-controlled games. Mixing physical computing, immersive theatre, interactive audiovisual installation, and experimental gaming, _ARE YOU PREPARED?_ examines emergency preparedness and crisis simulation as catalysts for change. 

Our course section is structured as a research and development lab, with students adopting roles as software developers, technical researchers, project managers, audiovisual systems specialists, sound designers, and creative technologists. Building on the success of the first prototype, created by MTEC students and tested with live audiences, we will focus on:     
* Body-controlled games utilizing sensors and computer vision.
* Human-computer interaction in live performance contexts.
* Integration of code-driven. audiovisual and interactive systems.  
* Updating software and hardware systems which have fallen obsolete.

Our work will culminate in a showcase of the next prototype at the 2025 MTEC Spring Show, with plans for future public exhibitions.

### COURSE GOALS  
To give students an introduction to:  
* approaching technical updates for projects with outdated systems.
* working with computer vision and browser-based tools for designing interactive experiences. 
* breaking down an iterative research and development process into manageable goals and tasks.    
* conducting technical research and self-directed troubleshooting.  
* leading and supporting team members in a collaborative work process.  
* organizing and presenting research and work-in-progress through technical demos, written reports, and prototypes.      
   
### LEARNING OUTCOMES       
By the end of the course students will be able to:    
* understand the basics of working with body-tracking to trigger interactive audiovisuals.    
* manage individual responsibilities and scheduled tasks in support of a collaborative team.  
* build iterative reports and prototypes for testing and further development.  
* use various methods for research and troubleshooting.  
* document and communicate their work and process.

## COURSE STRUCTURE  
Our core work will be structured as a Research and Development (R&D) Lab, with a focus on iterative testing and development. Each student will be assigned a role on the collaborative team (such as Software Developer, Technical Producer, Researcher, QA, etc.), leading and assisting varied project areas. Generally, R&D challenges will be assigned in three-week blocks, with the first two weeks dedicated to focused work on the Challenge. The third week culminates in submission and presentation of completed work to the entire team. Deliverables and presentations will vary among team members, ranging from summaries of research findings to technical demos and prototypes in progress. To keep ourselves effectively on target, we will gather for regular team meetings each morning and afternoon; for prepping, planning, and status updates. See below for more details.

## INCLUSIVITY 
Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage   
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement   
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
